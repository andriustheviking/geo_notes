# iOS GeoNotes App
### A Note-taking app that records your Geo-Location with each note.

This app was completed as an assignment for Oregon State University's CS 496. It uses __CoreLocation__ to get the Latitude and Longitude of the phone when a note is submitted. The notes are then saved using __CoreData__ for local storage. 

If the user denies location permission, the default location is set to OSU's campus in Corvallis.
